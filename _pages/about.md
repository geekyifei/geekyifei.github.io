<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Yifei Zong, an early-career researcher specializing in hydrology and water resources engineering from China 🇨🇳. I am deeply committed to a lifelong pursuit of understanding, exploration, and innovation, to contribute to a better natural environment and human community through continuous research. I love basketball 🏀, tennis 🎾， travel 👣, and music 🎶.

My research uses scientific computation methods, including numerical techniques and advanced deep learning approaches, to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and employ stochastic modeling approaches for uncertainty quantification to gain a deeper understanding of these systems. Additionally, I explore traditional numerical modeling methods to provide model-based solutions to real-world challenges <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-tNRjooAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
